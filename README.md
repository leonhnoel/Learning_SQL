# Learning SQL

I wanted to learn SQL, so I decided to take a course at LearnSQL.com and solve some challenges using SQL.

In this repository, you can find multiple challenges that I have solved over the past few weeks. 

I started with the SQL [Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/), which provided a nice introduction to SQL. 
After that, I alternated between solving [Preppin' Data](https://www.preppindata.com/challenges) challenges (originally aimed at Tableau Prep) and some Data with Danny challenges.

I have tried to structure the code in an organized way. Below, you can find a table with links to all the challenges and their solutions.
