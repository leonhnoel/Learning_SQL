# Learning SQL readme

In this repository, you can find multiple challenges that I have solved over the past few weeks. 

I started with the SQL Murder Mystery, which provided a nice introduction to SQL. 
After that, I alternated between solving Preppin' Data challenges (originally aimed at Tableau Prep) and some Data with Danny challenges.

I have tried to structure the code in an organized way. Below, you can find a table with links to all the challenges and their solutions.
