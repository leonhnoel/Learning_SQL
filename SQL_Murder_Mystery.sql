SELECT * 
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date = 20180115 AND city = "SQL City" AND type = "murder"

-- First witness lives on the last house on the street "Northwestern Dr".
-- The second witness is called "Annabel" and lives on "Franklin Ave"


-- First witness
SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = "Northwestern Dr" 
ORDER BY address_number DESC
LIMIT 1;

--Second witness
SELECT *

WHERE address_street_name = "Franklin Ave"
AND LOWER(name) LIKE "%annabel%";

-- First witness info:
